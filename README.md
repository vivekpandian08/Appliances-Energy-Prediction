1. Experiment with various parameters for linear and logistic regression (e.g. learning rate ‚àù) and 
report on your findings as how the error/accuracy varies for train and test sets with varying these parameters. 
Plot the results. Report the best values of the parameters.
2. Experiment with various thresholds for convergence for linear regression. 
Plot error results for train and test sets as a function of threshold and describe how varying the threshold affects error. 
Pick your best threshold and plot train and test error (in one figure) as a function of number of gradient descent iterations.
3. Pick ten features randomly and retrain your models only on these ten features. 
Compare train and test error results for the case of using your original set of features (greater than 15) and ten random features. 
Report the ten randomly selected features.
4. Now pick ten features that you think are best suited to predict the output, and retrain your models using these ten features. 
Compare to the case of using your original set of features and to the random features case. 
Did your choice of features provide better results than picking random features? Why? 
Did your choice of features provide better results than using all features?
